abstract = {<p>Computational modelling of metal-electrolyte reactions is central to the understanding and prediction of a wide range of physical phenomena, yet this is often challenging owing to the presence of numerical oscillations that arise due to dissimilar reaction rates. The ingress of hydrogen into metals is a paradigmatic example of a technologically-relevant phenomenon whose simulation is compromised by the stiffness of the reaction terms, as reaction rates vary over orders of magnitude and this significantly limits the time increment size. In this work, we present a lumped integration scheme for electro-chemical interface reactions that does not suffer from numerical oscillations. The scheme integrates the reactions in a consistent manner, while it also decouples neighbouring nodes and allows for larger time increments to be used without oscillations or convergence issues. The stability and potential of our scheme is demonstrated by simulating hydrogen ingress over a wide range of reaction rate constants and environmental conditions. While previous hydrogen uptake predictions were limited to time scales of minutes, the present lumped integration scheme enables conducting simulations over tens of years, allowing us to reach steady state conditions and quantify hydrogen ingress for time scales relevant to practical applications.</p>},

abstract = {This work studied the determination of the hydrogen fugacity during electrolytic charging. With a virgin surface, there were irregular permeation transients, attributed to irreproducible surface conditions. Cathodic pre-charging conditioned the entry side to a stable state. Permeability transients were used to measure the critical parameters in the thermodynamic relationship between hydrogen activity and electrochemical potential. At the same overpotential, the hydrogen fugacity in the pH 12.6 0.1M NaOH solution was higher than that in the pH 2 0.1M Na2SO4 solution, attributed to differences in (i) the hydrogen evolution reaction, (ii) the surface state, and (iii) the true surface area. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The adsorption and absorption kinetics are captured by means of Neumann-type generalised boundary conditions. The diffusion model includes the role of trapping, with a constant or evolving trap density, and the influence of the hydrostatic stress. Both conventional plasticity and strain gradient plasticity are used to model the mechanical behaviour of the solid. Notable differences are found in the estimated crack tip hydrogen concentrations when comparing with the common procedure of prescribing a constant hydrogen concentration at the crack surfaces.},

The functional p*(K) is shown to be well fitted by an analytical expression derived from the unstable equilibrium form of the decohesion theory plus some reasonable ad hoc assumptions for the necessary functional relationships. From the fitting of the theoretical equation to the experimental data are obtained numerical values for the hydrostatic component of stress at the crack front, for the equilibrium enhancement of concentration of hydrogen, and for the reduction by the hydrogen of the maximum cohesive resistive force. The magnitudes of these numbers and their trends with K are in agreement with expectations from the decohesion theory but with no other extant point of view. {\textcopyright} 1974.},

@article{Sarkar2011,
abstract = {We propose a simple, but novel mathematical and numerical approach to describe mass transport in dilute solutions, taking into consideration ionic interactions. Our proposed approach treats fluxes due to ionic interactions as additional unknowns in the transport equation. Through variational arguments, we derive a simple expression for these ionic fluxes in terms of the electroneutrality condition, which allows for a straightforward treatment of the new unknowns. Furthermore, a finite element formulation based on our mathematical model is presented. Finally, using the distribution of the interionic flux density and an energy dissipation function, we show that besides properly capturing flow due to ionic interactions, our model can also describe independent ionic flow as predicted by the conventional Nernst-Planck equation in regions where ionic interactions are weak. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Hageman2019b,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 The Author(s) A model has been developed to simulate fractures which are pressurised using a non-Newtonian (power-law)fluid. The flow in the surrounding, deformable porous medium is described with a non-Newtonian fluid as well. The resulting model can represent the propagation of pressurised fractures, leak-off and the interstitial fluid pressure in a saturated porous medium. The resulting equations have been discretised using Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS), cast into a traditional finite element datastructure using B{\'{e}}zier extraction. It is shown that lumped integration of the fracture inflow terms is needed to obtain non-oscillatory results for the fluid velocity normal to the discontinuity, and an integration scheme has been derived to prevent non-physical fluid leak-off from the fracture tips. Simulations have been carried out for a typical hydraulic fracture problem. The results show the dependence of the fluid leak-off and the fracture tip pressure on the power-law fluid index. Shear-thinning fluids result in a larger amount of fluid leak-off compared to Newtonian fluids, but their lower effective viscosity results in a higher pressure at the fracture tip. These effects influence the propagation velocity of the pressurised fracture, and thus demonstrate the importance of properly modelling the non-Newtonian character of pressurising fluids.},

abstract = {Models have been developed for the simulation of multiphase fluid flow within fractured poroelastic media. They allow for the fluid phases to interact inside fractures, without requiring explicit simulations in the interior of the fractures. The models retain the ability to retrieve the fluid velocity profile in the fracture by post-processing. The models for flow within a fracture are combined with a formulation for multiphase flow within the poroelastic medium. They have been implemented using isogeometric analysis, cast into a traditional finite element format using B{\'{e}}zier extraction. Pressure oscillations around the fracture are prevented by using a lumped integration scheme for the pressure capacity. The effect of interactions between the fluid phases is first demonstrated for a single fracture through parameter studies. Next, two cases with a more practical orientation are simulated. They show, inter alia, that the inclusion of interactions between the fluid phases can result in fluid back-flow.},

@article{Kristensen2020a,
abstract = {We present a gradient-based theoretical framework for predicting hydrogen assisted fracture in elastic-plastic solids. The novelty of the model lies in the combination of: (i) stress-assisted diffusion of solute species, (ii) strain gradient plasticity, and (iii) a hydrogen-sensitive phase field fracture formulation, inspired by first principles calculations. The theoretical model is numerically implemented using a mixed finite element formulation and several boundary value problems are addressed to gain physical insight and showcase model predictions. The results reveal the critical role of plastic strain gradients in rationalising decohesion-based arguments and capturing the transition to brittle fracture observed in hydrogen-rich environments. Large crack tip stresses are predicted, which in turn raise the hydrogen concentration and reduce the fracture energy. The computation of the steady state fracture toughness as a function of the cohesive strength shows that cleavage fracture can be predicted in otherwise ductile metals using sensible values for the material parameters and the hydrogen concentration. In addition, we compute crack growth resistance curves in a wide variety of scenarios and demonstrate that the model can appropriately capture the sensitivity to: the plastic length scales, the fracture length scale, the loading rate and the hydrogen concentration. Model predictions are also compared with fracture experiments on a modern ultra-high strength steel, AerMet100. A promising agreement is observed with experimental measurements of threshold stress intensity factor Kth over a wide range of applied potentials.},
